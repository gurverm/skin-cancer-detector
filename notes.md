# features: consider this to be our 'input' data
# labels: consider this to be our 'output' data or what we want to predict

# ML learning types:
    - supervised learning: features and labels are given
    - unsupervised learning: features are given, but labels are not given
    - reinforcement learning: features and labels are not given, but there is a reward system between agent and environment

# How does TensorFlow work? 

Tensorflow has two main components that we will try to understand
    - graphs: tensorflow works by building a graph of defined computations. nothing is computed or stored in this graph is it simply a way of defining the operations that are written in code
    - sessions: allows parts of the graph to be executed. it allocated memory and resources and handles the execution of the operations and computations weve defined
